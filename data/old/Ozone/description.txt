Abstract: Two ground ozone level data sets are included in this collection. One is the eight hour peak set (eighthr.data), the other is the one hour peak set (onehr.data). Those data were collected from 1998 to 2004 at the Houston, Galveston and Brazoria area.

Data Set Information:

For a list of attributes, please refer to those two .names files. They use the following naming convention: 

All the attribute start with T means the temperature measured at different time throughout the day; and those starts with WS indicate the wind speed at various time. 

WSR_PK: continuous. peek wind speed -- resultant (meaning average of wind vector) 

WSR_AV: continuous. average wind speed 

T_PK: continuous. Peak T 
T_AV: continuous. Average T 
T85: continuous. T at 850 hpa level (or about 1500 m height) 
RH85: continuous. Relative Humidity at 850 hpa 
U85: continuous. (U wind - east-west direction wind at 850 hpa) 
V85: continuous. V wind - N-S direction wind at 850 
HT85: continuous. Geopotential height at 850 hpa, it is about the same as height at low altitude 
T70: continuous. T at 700 hpa level (roughly 3100 m height) 

RH70: continuous. 
U70: continuous. 
V70: continuous. 
HT70: continuous. 

T50: continuous. T at 500 hpa level (roughly at 5500 m height) 

RH50: continuous. 
U50: continuous. 
V50: continuous. 
HT50: continuous. 

KI: continuous. K-Index [Web Link] 
TT: continuous. T-Totals [Web Link] 
SLP: continuous. Sea level pressure 
SLP_: continuous. SLP change from previous day 

Precp: continuous. -- precipitation
